summary: I had no experience, no diploma and I landed a job as a developer, here is how.
---

I wanted to be a front-end developer. I was in my twenties, I had no diploma, no experience and knew nobody in the tech.
I'm french and look for jobs all over france, I was ready to move out for a job.
This is all I learned through my journey of job hunting.

## The resume

Save yourself time and energy and pick any [resume template here](https://www.canva.com/templates/?query=resume).

Golden rule of job hunting : <a name="golden-rule"></a>**the purpose of your application is to be read by an HR**.
This HR has no idea that if you know TypeScript you obsviously know JavaScript, so make sure to explicitly write all technologies that you master, nothing should be implicit.

Now, you filled your resume, you see the "professionnal experiences" section empty... Let's be real, betting on this section to find a job is unrealistic.
The only thing you have left is to have good looking projects, a good cover letter[^2], an attractive "about me" paragraph or look insane by contributing to open source!

[^2]: I'm serious, some recruiters called me back just because they liked my cover letter

### Good looking projects

> Good looking projects are hard to pull out in couple of weeks and I need to find a job now... what to do?

It is fine, use what you have. The worst quality you should show is decent and show maximum 3 projects. it is ok to have only one project, less choices the HR has better it is.

Then, describe what you did in those projects on your resume, example :
- wrote unit tests with Vitest
- migrated from the page router to app router in Nextjs
- setup a github workflow to run my tests before merging
- created wireframes with Figma

You find those descriptions in job offers below "missions of this job" usually.
I like to reuse them to speak the same language as the HR. ([see the golden rule](#golden-rule))

### A good cover letter

# Knock, Knock! I might be your future colleague!

Hello to the entire team,

Here is my unsolicited application for the Front-end Developer position. I am a young developer with experience in the TV industry, and I am looking for "THE company" to grow with.

## WHY ME AND NOT SOMEONE ELSE?

Because I am...

- Recommended by my former colleagues on LinkedIn!
- Independent - I've designed several websites as a self-taught developer (check out my portfolio).
- Versatile - I've worked with various technologies (JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, PHP, and many more).
- Bold - I'm applying with this unconventional letter!

## "MR. LESNÉ, YOU LACK EXPERIENCE"

In that case... TEST ME!

How?

- Provide me with a design to replicate in 48 hours.
- Give me an online technical test (e.g., codingame.com).

## WOULD LIKE TO MEET ME?

To do that, it's quite simple:

- Give me a call: 0606060606
- Send me an email: your@email.fr
- Ignore me :(

I hope to have the opportunity to meet you soon!

Benjamin LESNÉ,

Your (perhaps) future developer.

0606060606

### Contributing to open source

> But I don't know what I'm doing, how can I contribute to open source?

By doing easy issues like translating the documentation or fixing typo here and there.
It is not much but that will show that you understand the process of code review, git, github and also (hopefully) impress the HR.
You could even contribute to the library the job required, success guarantee!

And obviously, add to your resume that you are contributor.

[Check this post out to know how to contribute to MDN](/blog/How-to-contribute-to-MDN).

### What to NOT do?

Avoid resume gaps.
I have been a delivery guy, I did not want to put it on my resume which made a gap of few years.
An HR responded to my front end developer applicaton: This is confusing, what were you doing before? Feel free to update your resume and send it to us.

How many HR thought the same thing and threw my resume away?

Avoid gaps.


## The portfolio

Any project (portfolio included) that you show MUST USE A CUSTOM DOMAIN AND BE RESPONSIVE. you don't believe me? check [these tweets out](https://twitter.com/illyism/status/1700421209525985332) :

![your websites must be responsive](/static/images/posts/your-websites-must-be-responsive.png)

![use custom domains](/static/images/posts/use-custom-domains.png)

HRs get hundreds of applications a day, the first red flag[^1] you will give them will be instant rejection.
To understand the recruiter point of view check [this video out from Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V_q9MJDrZY)

[^1]: I find those red flags pretty bs but you are not here to be right, you are here to show what the HR wants to see

> Building a portfolio takes time and energy...

I got you, check those portfolio templates out:
- [based on VueJs](https://gridsome-portfolio-starter.netlify.app/) ([repository](https://github.com/drehimself/gridsome-portfolio-starter))
- [based on Nextjs](https://react-portfolio-template.netlify.app/) ([repository](https://github.com/chetanverma16/react-portfolio-template))

## How to apply?

use trello to track your applications (link to job offer)

where:
LinkedIn...

for the job hunt on LinkedIn, use bolean filters to get rid of most the noise (senior ads and stuff),
if you run out of job ads you can remove the filters to have a wider range of results.

développeur front NOT (((2 OR 3 OR 4 OR 5 OR 6 OR 7 OR 8 OR 9 OR 10 OR 3+ OR 5+ OR 2+) OR (deux OR trois OR quatre OR cinq OR six OR sept OR huit OR neuf OR dix)) AND années OR ans) NOT (intermediate OR mid OR senior OR lead OR principal OR expert OR confirmé OR confirmée OR expérimenté)

## I got an interview! What should I do?

take notes duiring the interview, that is a nice counter for psycho recruiters that think taking notes means you are a serious person but on top of it, it will help you to have info to find questions to ask cause god knows recruiters love to have questions from candidates.

Get info about the company (check their websites, waht they do, who is the client), contact previous employee to know how is it to work there and what exactly is the job?

for technical interview I recommend training with codingame. It is always the same exercises, you know them by heart after couple of times. Record those exercice so you can train them afterward!
here is a repo of some technical test I got (some are in french but a quick translation with deepL should do the trick)

take notes duiring the interview, that is a nice counter for psycho recruiters that think taking notes means you are a serious person but on top of it, it will help you to have info to find questions to ask cause god knows recruiters love to have questions from candidates. 

## I got an offer! What next?

you can contact previous employee to know how is it to work there. Honestly, there are a bunch of spooky companies out there, that saved me multiple times from toxic environnement.

check the salries on glassdoors 
get in contact with Syndicats, they may have info about what salary you can ask. Glassdoor also helps but it is not ideal there are not so many salaries declared

## last notes

if you are going to job hunt later : try to have some activities on your github. I had a recruiters that he saw that I started being active with my github since couple of years and he liked it

## FAQ

### I'm applying everyday, how long to get contacted by a company?
From the first day of applying, 1 week.

### I'm applying everyday, how long until I get a job offer?
From the first day of applying to the first job offer, 3 months.

### How many applications should I send per day?
I aimed 10 per day, working on it 7 days a week. Don't burn yourself out.

### How many interviews should I do per day?
Over 2 per day I was burning out. Careful, job hunting is a marathon not a sprint.

### Should I do a custom application for each company?
I don't recommend it.
If you do this you aim for quality applications instead of quantity.
The thing is, your resume sucks cause you have no experience. You can make it custom as much as you want, at the end of the day, you have no experience.
This is why I aimed for quantity by spreading the web with my resume.
