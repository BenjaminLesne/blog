summary: I had no experience, no diploma and I landed a job as a developer, here is how.
---

I wanted to become a front-end developer. I was in my twenties, I had no diploma, no experience and knew nobody in the tech.
I looked for jobs all over france and was ready to move out for a job.
This is all I learned through my journey of job hunting.

## The resume

Save yourself time and energy and pick any [resume template here](https://www.canva.com/templates/?query=resume).

Golden rule of job hunting : <a name="golden-rule"></a>**the purpose of your application is to be read by an HR**.
This HR has no idea that if you know TypeScript you obsviously know JavaScript, so make sure to explicitly write all technologies that you master, nothing should be implicit.

Now, you filled your resume, you see the "professionnal experiences" section empty... Let's be real, betting on this section to find a job is unrealistic.
The only thing you have left is to have good looking projects, a good cover letter, an attractive "about me" paragraph or look insane by contributing to open source!


### Good looking projects

> Good looking projects are hard to pull out in couple of weeks and I need to find a job now... what to do?

It is fine, use what you have. The worst quality you should show is decent and show maximum 3 projects. It is ok to only have one project, less choices the HR has better it is.

Then, describe what you did in those projects on your resume, example :
- wrote unit tests with Vitest
- migrated from the page router to app router in Nextjs
- setup a github workflow to run my tests before merging
- created wireframes with Figma

You find those descriptions in job offers below "missions of this job" usually.
I like to reuse them to speak the same language as the HR. ([see the golden rule](#golden-rule))

### A good cover letter

> Bruh... writting a cover letter takes ages...

Once again, I got you homie :

<details>
<summary>click here to see the english version of my cover letter!</summary>
```markdown
Subject: Knock, Knock! I might be your future colleague!

Hello to the entire team,

Here is my application for the Front-end Developer position.
I am a young self taught developer and I am looking for "THE company" to grow with.

WHY ME AND NOT SOMEONE ELSE?

Because I am...

- Independent - I've built several websites by myself (check out my portfolio here).
- Versatile - I've worked with various technologies (JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, NextJs, and many more).
- Bold - I'm applying with this unconventional letter!

"MR. LESNÃ‰, YOU LACK EXPERIENCE"

In that case... TEST ME!

How?

- Provide me with a design to replicate in 48 hours.
- Give me an online technical test (e.g., codingame.com).

WOULD LIKE TO MEET ME?

To do that, it's quite simple:

- Give me a call: 0606060606
- Send me an email: your@email.fr
- Ignore me :(

I hope to have the opportunity to meet you soon!

Benjamin LESNÃ‰,

Your (perhaps) future developer.

0606060606
```
</details>

What is the recipe for a good cover letter? Marketing.
I suck ass at it, thank god out there some marketers are ready to give an already made cover letter for an email. 
I completely forgot who is the french lady I took this cover letter from... So... no shout out for her ðŸ˜ 

Multiple recruiters told me I did not match the job but they gave me a shot because they enjoyed my cover letter.
One of them especially liked the `"MR. LESNÃ‰, YOU LACK EXPERIENCE" In that case... TEST ME!`, you see this? This is &nbsp;**a u d a c i t y**, one of the few things you have when no experience.

As you can see there is a "Subject:" in this cover letter, well, I lied. This is a an email not a cover letter.
Who whould not click on an email with "Knock, Knock! I might be your future colleague!" as a subjet? (to be honest, it sounds better in french)
I also used it as a cover letter that worked fine for me.


### Contributing to open source

> But I don't know what I'm doing, how can I contribute to open source?

By doing easy issues like translating the documentation or fixing typo here and there.
It is not much but that will show that you understand the process of code review, git, github and also (hopefully) impress the HR.
You could even contribute to the library the job required, success guarantee!

And obviously, add to your resume that you are contributor.

[Check this post out to know how to contribute to MDN](/blog/How-to-contribute-to-MDN).

### What to NOT do?

- Avoid resume gaps.

I have been a delivery guy, I did not want to put it on my resume which made a gap of few years.
An HR responded to my applicaton with : `This is confusing, what were you doing before? Feel free to update your resume and send it to us`.

How many HR thought the same thing and threw my resume away?
Avoid gaps.

- Know the right technologies

Check the technologies required in job offers and realize that this cool new framework with an insane developer experience has literally no job offers compared to this old framework.

You want a job as a front-end developer? Forget about Svelte man, just go for react and enjoy the financial experience.

Also, the HR has no idea that if you know Vue you can probably handle react.


## The portfolio

Any project (portfolio included) that you show MUST USE A CUSTOM DOMAIN AND BE RESPONSIVE. you don't believe me? Look at those tweets :

<Tweet
  name="Ilias Ism"
  handle="illyism"
  tweetId="1700421209525985332"
  avatar={<AvatarIliasIsm />}
  date={new Date('2023-09-09')}
>
<p>I hired many devs as CTO.</p>

<p>You showed up in my feed.</p> 

<p>Tip: make sure all your websites are great and work on mobile.</p>

<p>I took 5 seconds clicking your bio link etc.</p>

<p>Would be an instant red flag.</p>
</Tweet>

<Tweet
  name="Ilias Ism"
  handle="illyism"
  tweetId="1700426066358047037"
  avatar={<AvatarIliasIsm />}
  date={new Date('2023-09-09')}
>
<p>Get your own domain name too ðŸ˜…</p>
</Tweet>

HRs get hundreds of applications a day, the first red flag[^1] you will give them will be instant rejection.
So no misspelling anywhere, no "I'm a beginner" and no applications if your portfolio is not finished.
To understand the recruiter point of view watch [this video from Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V_q9MJDrZY)

[^1]: I find those red flags pretty bs but you are not here to be right, you are here to show what the HR wants to see

> Building a portfolio takes time and energy...

I got you, here are some templates :
- [based on VueJs](https://gridsome-portfolio-starter.netlify.app/) ([repository](https://github.com/drehimself/gridsome-portfolio-starter))
- [based on Nextjs](https://react-portfolio-template.netlify.app/) ([repository](https://github.com/chetanverma16/react-portfolio-template))

## How to apply?

### LinkedIn
You search for "junior developer" and you get 99% of job offers requiring 25 years of experience, that is called : noise.
This is why I use LinkedIn because you have boolean filters to reduce the noise.

Here are search queries with boolean filters : 
```
("web developer" OR "software engineer") AND TypeScript NOT "senior" NOT "experienced"
```

or at the peak of my art:

```
Front-end developer" NOT (((2 OR 3 OR 4 OR 5 OR 6 OR 7 OR 8 OR 9 OR 10 OR 3+ OR 5+ OR 2+) OR (two OR three OR four OR five OR six OR seven OR eight OR nine OR ten)) AND years OR years) NOT (intermediate OR mid OR senior OR lead OR principal OR expert OR experienced)
```

[This LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a524335) gives the theory.
To get real examples just ask ChatGPT.

Basically, you only need this at the beginning of your job hunt, more time goes, less offers to apply you have and more likely you are to remove those filters.
If you don't, someday, you might have no offer to apply to. 

### Track your applications

You applied a ton, now you have a ton a vocal messages of recruiters that want an interview with you and you cannot hear very well the name of the company in the message...
You managed to find the name but cannot find the job offer anymore... you have no idea what you applied to, yikes.

Track your applications with  [Trello](https://trello.com/), here is my board :

![trello job hunt board](/static/images/trello.png)

Everytime you apply you can add a card with the company name as title and add in the description the link to the job offer you applied to.
From there, anything happens you move the card in the appropriate column AND write in the comments of the card any useful information (datetime of appointments, if there is remote days or not, what product are they building, etc.)

Now, when a recruiters calls you, you can easily go to your board, check the job offer you applied to and see any comments you added.
This is important to succeed in job interviews, they expect you to remember what they told you in the previous rounds.

## I got an interview! What should I do?

Take notes and ask questions during the interview.
Some HRs think you are not a serious person if don't do these things ([remember the golden rule!](#golden-rule)).
I learned these from an HR of a company I worked at.

Get info about the company (check their websites, what they do, who is the client), contact previous employee to know how is it to work there and what exactly is the job.
The recruiters will probably ask you what do you know about the company, I scored points multiple times because they saw I gave an actual interest to the company.

If you have no time, I would recommend to contact previous employees. All you have to do is repeat what they told you about the job in the interview.
The cherry on the top : those employees may also be recruiting and your resume will be given to the HR by an employee of the company, perfect.

Check on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) the salaries people get in the company. They will ask you how much you want pretty quickly so be ready for it.

## The technical test

Most of my tests were [codingames](https://www.codingame.com/start/), the pool of technical tests given by recruiters from this plateform is pretty small so you regularly end up resolving the same thing over and over again.
So... record those exercises so you can train them later on.

When it is not a codingame they usually give a design and few days to build it.
I kept those! You can see them in [this repository]() TODO PUT LINK

## I got an offer! What now?

Honestly, there are a bunch of spooky companies out there, contact some previous employees to know how is it to work there.
Check their reviews on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/)
This saved me multiple times from toxic environnement and contracts that play with the limits of legality.

## Last note

If you plan to job hunt months from now : try to have some activities on your github.
Some recruiters liked that I was active for years on github evenknow I had no professionnal experience.

Think twice what you are going to show on your resume, HRs use softwares to manage applications and store your resume for a while.

Don't be afraid to say you don't know in interviews.

Practice. This is how you get good at job hunting.
I did not succeed at my first job hunt, I spent 3 months hunting and got no job offers BUT I learned how to get comfortable in interviews and understood what knowledge I was lacking and spend the next months working on it then tried again.

## FAQ

### I'm applying everyday, how long to get contacted by a company?
From the first day of applying, 1 week.

### I'm applying everyday, how long until I get a job offer?
From the first day of applying to the first job offer, 3 months.

### How many applications should I send per day?
I aimed 10 per day, working 7 days a week. Don't burn yourself out.

### How many interviews should I do per day?
Over 2 per day I was burning out. Careful, job hunting is a marathon not a sprint.

### Should I apply even though I don't have the experience?
Yes. There is very few job offers for juniors and a lot of HRs ask way too many years of experience for a junior position (probably to reduce the amount of applications they receive).
I was applying to offers requiring 0 to 3 years of experience even though I had no experience.

### Should I do a custom application for each company?
I don't recommend it.
If you do this you aim for quality applications instead of quantity.
The thing is, your resume sucks cause you have no experience. You can make it custom as much as you want, at the end of the day, you have no experience.
This is why I aimed for quantity by spreading the web with my generic resume.
