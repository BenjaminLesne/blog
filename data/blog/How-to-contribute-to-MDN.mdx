summary: The easiest way to contribute to open-source is by translating a documentation. Let me guide you through it :)

## Find the issue

[Pick an easy issue that excites you in the content repository of MDN](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22%2C%22effort%3A+small%22+).

[For example, here is the one I did](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/27887)


## Setup the project on your machine

For your information, this blog post is based on [the MDN official guidelines](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Clone the repository

[Go to the MDN/content repository](https://github.com/mdn/content)

Then, click on this beautiful fork button middle top right of the page

![fork button](/static/images/fork_mdn_content.png)

Now, you should get into a page with a button `Create fork`, press this bad boy.


It should redirects you to :

```
https://github.com/[your github username]/content
```

Now clone the repository on your machine:


- with SSH:
```bash
cd folder/of/your/choice/content
yarn
yarn start  
git clone git@github.com:[your github username]/content.git
```

or

- with HTTP:
```bash
cd folder/of/your/choice/content
yarn
yarn start 
git clone https://github.com/[your github username]/content.git
```

### Install dependencies

I assume that you have yarn and node installed already, if not :

<details>
<summary>click here</summary>


The easy way to install node for windows and macos is [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

For linux : using your package manager seems easier. From there, good luck 🫡

For more info see the [official node documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)

Now you can install yarn like this :

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

More [info to install yarn here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

</details>

Now cd to the repository you just cloned, install the dependencies with yarn and start the server :

```bash
cd folder/of/your/choice/content
yarn install
yarn start 
```

Now, if you go to [http://localhost:5042/](http://localhost:5042/) you should see the MDN documentation


## How to edit files

Your are supposed to have read the following before doing any change :

- [writing guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines)
- [Writing style guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide)
- [How to write markdowns in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Howto/Markdown_in_MDN)

These are verbose no one wants to read that...

So, since your are probably doing a `small effort` issue that require a small amount of changes, you can code first and then read the parts you need with the changes you made.
And I guess you good, worst scenario you change the few lines you added 🤷

Tip: If the page you are supposed to fix is :

```plaintext
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
```

then you know that the path to the file you have to work on is :

```plaintext
rootFolder/files/en-us/docs/web/javascript
```

## And then?!

All you have to do is push your changes. (don't forget to check the writing guidelines)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix stuff"
git push
```
You might need to `git push --set-upstream origin [your branch name]` if you haven't pushed this branch before.

Now, go to your forked repository:
```plaintext
https://github.com/[your github username]/content
```

And click on "Compare & pull request"

![forked MDN content repository](/static/images/compare-pull-request-from-fork-mdn-content.png)

You should get into a page with a description prefilled with :

```markdown
<!-- 🙌 Thanks for contributing to MDN Web Docs. Adding details below will help us to merge your PR faster. -->

### Description

<!-- ✍️ Summarize your changes in one or two sentences -->

### Motivation

<!-- ❓ Why are you making these changes and how do they help readers? -->

### Additional details

<!-- 🔗 Link to release notes, vendor docs, bug trackers, source control, or other places providing more context -->

### Related issues and pull requests

<!-- 🔨 If this fully resolves a GitHub issue, use "Fixes #123" -->
<!-- 👉 Highlight related pull requests using "Relates to #123" -->
<!-- ❗ If another pull request should be merged first, use "**Depends on:** #123" -->


<!-- 👷‍♀️ After submitting, go to the "Checks" tab of your PR for the build status -->

```

When everything is good, the title, the description, the changes and also that the pull request is from your branch TO the base repository MDN/content (this should be set automatically).

Click `create pull request` and you good. Congrats you made your first pull request to an open-source project.
Now keep an eye for any comment or approval from the MDN team (they usually show do it in few hours or the next day).

This contribution is one of the ingredients to make your resume shine.
If you are interested I wrote a post on [How to find your first dev job](http://localhost:3000/blog/How-to-find-your-first-dev-job).

That's it. Bye. 👋
