🚀 The Scenario Explorer is now LIVE!

This is a tool that visualizes the impact of different policy scenarios on CO₂ emissions of the building industry

The tool is accessible at \[ example.com \].

More info below! 🧵👇

[IMAGE TO BE ADDED]
THE GOAL: help policymakers & researchers to explore the impact of various strategies on carbon footprints like:

- increase circularity and reuse of materials
- reduce space per habitant
- reduce transport emissions

Users can view emissions for each building type, country, material, and more!

You can download the displayed data as an image or as a spreadsheet and visualize it with three type of graphs in the app.

The data comes from the KU Leuven team as part of the ‘Analysis of Life-cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Removals of EU Buildings and Construction’ study funded by the European Commission.

On the tech side, I built the app entirely from scratch with:
🔹 React
🔹 TanStack Router
🔹 React Query
🔹 Shadcn-UI
🔹 Recharts
🔹 Python
🔹 DuckDB to process scenario files from the study team

[IN PROGRESS, add @ and tag?]
A huge thank you to @Shadwa_Eissa for the amazing data visualization and overall design! I closely collaborated with her to build the app.

Also, special thanks to the KU Leuven team, Martin Rock, Nicolas Alaux, Karen Allacker, Ronny Moreas, and Delphine Ramon.

The collaboration with all of you was fantastic! 🙏
