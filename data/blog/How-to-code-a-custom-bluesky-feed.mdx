## Introduction

I found the feed builders a bit limited so I wanted to build my own.
I managed to find a [Feed Generator template](https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator) but was completely lost in the code. This is why I decided to make my own from scratch!

## TL;DR

We are building this:

![custom feed architecture](/static/images/bluesky-feed-architecture.png)

## Setup the repository

- Create a directory then initialize npm and git:

```bash
mkdir my-custom-feed &&
cd my-custom-feed &&
npm init es6 -y &&
git init
```

- In your root directory, create a `.gitignore` file with the following content:

```bash
# dependencies
/node_modules

# env
.env
.env*.local

# database
local.db*
```

- In your root, create a `tsconfig.json` file with this content:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["es2022"],
    "module": "node16",
    "target": "es2022",
    "moduleResolution": "node16",
    "removeComments": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "allowJs": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "checkJs": true
  },
  "include": [".eslintrc.cjs", "**/*.ts", "**/*.cjs", "**/*.js"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

- Create the entry point of your app in the src directory and log out Hello world

```bash
mkdir src && echo 'console.log("hello world");' > src/server.ts
```

- Install typescript, tsx to run the server.ts file and nodes types

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript tsx @types/node
```

- You should see "hello world" in the terminal when starting the server:

```bash
npx tsx watch ./src/server.ts
```

## Connect to the jetstream

Now, we need data. Let's connect to bluesky's jetstreams to get the newly created posts, likes, and more.

- To connect to a jetstream, install @skyware/jetstream and ws:

```bash
npm install @skyware/jetstream ws &&
npm install --save-dev @types/ws
```

- create a jetstream.ts file with the following content in the src directory:

```ts
import { Jetstream } from '@skyware/jetstream'
import WebSocket from 'ws'

export const jetstream = new Jetstream({
  wantedCollections: ['app.bsky.feed.post'],
  ws: WebSocket,
})

jetstream.onCreate('app.bsky.feed.post', (event) => {
  console.log(event.commit.record)
})
```

- Now, start the jetstream in your `server.ts` (be ready to stop your server this is going to spam logs):

```ts
import { jetstream } from './jetstream.js'

jetstream.start()
```

You should have crazy amount of logs poping in your terminal when running the server now.
Good job, you succesffully connected to the jetstream 👍

You can stop the server for now (CTRL + C).
Now that we have the data, we need to store only the relevant posts in our database.

## Setup the database

We will use [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview) and SQLite (see [drizzle doc for sqlite](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started/sqlite-new)) but you can use whatever database you'd like.

- Install the dependencies

```bash
npm i drizzle-orm @libsql/client dotenv
npm i -D drizzle-kit
```

- Create the src/database directory and an empty schemas.ts file inside it by running the following command in your root:

```bash
mkdir src/database && touch src/database/schemas.ts
```

- Add this to the schema.ts file:

```ts
import { int, sqliteTable, text } from 'drizzle-orm/sqlite-core'

export const postsTable = sqliteTable('posts', {
  id: int().primaryKey({ autoIncrement: true }),
  uri: text().notNull().unique(),
  interestScore: int().notNull(),
  createdAt: int({ mode: 'timestamp' }),
})
```

- create a .env file in your root directory and add this DATABASE_URL variable:

```bash
touch .env &&
echo "DATABASE_URL=file:src/database/local.db" >> .env
```

- load the env variable with dotenv in your server.ts file by adding this import at the top of the file:

```ts
import 'dotenv/config'
```

- Create a `drizzle.config.ts` file in the root of your project and add the following content:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'drizzle-kit'

export default defineConfig({
  out: './drizzle',
  schema: './src/database/schemas.ts',
  dialect: 'sqlite',
  dbCredentials: {
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL as string,
  },
})
```

- create a `database.ts` file in src/database directory and add the following content:

```ts
import { createClient } from '@libsql/client'
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/libsql'

const client = createClient({
  url: process.env.DATABASE_URL as string,
})

await client.execute('PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL')

export const db = drizzle(client)
```

<details>
<summary>Why do we enable WAL? (to know more click here)</summary>

By default, SQLite operates in a mode that locks the database during write operations, preventing simultaneous reads and writes. For example, if someone requests the feed while a new post is being written, the feed request would be blocked until the write operation finishes.

Enabling WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode solves this by allowing concurrent reads and writes, ensuring smoother performance and better user experience.

</details>

- Now generate your local.db file by applying the post schema:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

Now we can add posts for our feed to the database. But first, we need an algorithm to decide if we should store or not the post.

## Algorithm

What we look for is posts talking about javascript and with embedded content (image, video, links, etc.). Also, we don't want NSFW labels (see [doc for more](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/moderation#label-values)).

- In your jetstream.ts file, add the following function:

```ts
import type { CommitCreate } from '@skyware/jetstream'
// ...rest of the imports

const BLOCK_LIST = ['check doc for NSFW labels', 'label2', 'label3']
const ALLOWED_REGEX = /\bjavascript\b/i

type StandardAlgoArgs = {
  record: CommitCreate<'app.bsky.feed.post'>['record']
}
export function standardAlgo({ record }: StandardAlgoArgs) {
  let score = 0
  let denied = false

  switch (record.$type) {
    case 'app.bsky.feed.post': {
      record.labels?.values.forEach((value) => {
        if (BLOCK_LIST.includes(value.val)) {
          denied = true
        }
      })

      if (denied) {
        return 0
      }

      const isAboutWebdev = ALLOWED_REGEX.test(record.text)
      if (isAboutWebdev) {
        score = score + 1

        if (record.embed) {
          score = score + 1
        }
      }

      break
    }

    default:
      break
  }

  return score
}

// ... rest of the code
```

- Now, use the standardAlgo function to decide if we store the received post to the database:

```ts
import { db } from './database/database.js'
import { postsTable } from './database/schemas.js'
// ... rest of the imports

// ...

jetstream.onCreate('app.bsky.feed.post', async (event) => {
  const record = event.commit.record
  const interestScore = standardAlgo({ record })

  if (interestScore > 0) {
    const did = event.did
    const recordKey = event.commit.rkey

    await db.insert(postsTable).values({
      interestScore,
      uri: `at://${did}/app.bsky.feed.post/${recordKey}`,
    })
  }
})
```

<details>
<summary>Your jetstream.ts file should look like this now (click to see):</summary>

```ts
import { db } from './database/database.js'
import { postsTable } from './database/schemas.js'
import type { CommitCreate } from '@skyware/jetstream'
import { Jetstream } from '@skyware/jetstream'
import WebSocket from 'ws'

const BLOCK_LIST = ['check doc for NSFW labels', 'label2', 'label3']
const ALLOWED_REGEX = /\bjavascript\b/i

type StandardAlgoArgs = {
  record: CommitCreate<'app.bsky.feed.post'>['record']
}
export function standardAlgo({ record }: StandardAlgoArgs) {
  let score = 0
  let denied = false

  switch (record.$type) {
    case 'app.bsky.feed.post': {
      record.labels?.values.forEach((value) => {
        if (BLOCK_LIST.includes(value.val)) {
          denied = true
        }
      })

      if (denied) {
        return 0
      }

      const isAboutWebdev = ALLOWED_REGEX.test(record.text)
      if (isAboutWebdev) {
        score = score + 1

        if (record.embed) {
          score = score + 1
        }
      }

      break
    }

    default:
      break
  }

  return score
}

export const jetstream = new Jetstream({
  wantedCollections: ['app.bsky.feed.post'],
  ws: WebSocket,
})

jetstream.onCreate('app.bsky.feed.post', async (event) => {
  const record = event.commit.record
  const interestScore = standardAlgo({ record })

  if (interestScore > 0) {
    const did = event.did
    const recordKey = event.commit.rkey

    await db.insert(postsTable).values({
      interestScore,
      uri: `at://${did}/app.bsky.feed.post/${recordKey}`,
    })

    console.log('added post to db!')
  }
})
```

</details>

If not already done, start your server:

```bash
npx tsx watch ./src/server.ts
```

Currently our database is getting filled with posts.
Now we would like to return our posts when requested, let's make our api!

## API

Bluesky is going to hit the endpoint `/xrpc/app.bsky.feed.getFeedSkeleton` to retrieve the feed's posts. Let's make the endpoint with express.

- install express

```bash
npm install express &&
npm install --save-dev @types/express
```

- In server.ts, create the endpoint and return the last 10 posts:

```ts
// ...rest of the imports
import express from 'express'
import { db } from './database/database.js'
import { postsTable } from './database/schemas.js'
import { desc } from 'drizzle-orm'

// ...rest of the code

const app = express()

app.get('/xrpc/app.bsky.feed.getFeedSkeleton', async (req, res) => {
  const feed = await db
    .select({
      post: postsTable.uri,
    })
    .from(postsTable)
    .orderBy(desc(postsTable.interestScore))
    .limit(10)

  res.json({
    feed,
  })
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log(`Feed app listening on port 3000`)
})
```

When running tsx server.ts, you should be able to get your posts at http://localhost:3000/xrpc/app.bsky.feed.getFeedSkeleton

Great, now our feed is alive but bluesky needs to know where our app is running. Prodiving http://localhost won't cut it, we have to deploy our app online. I'm not sure SQlite works with serverless so we are going for a VPS.

## Deploy to a VPS

This post is already long so I will shamelessly link to the tutorial of CJ setting up a VPS with coolify [here](https://youtu.be/taJlPG82Ucw?si=6X-tUxQ8_5BlCINx&t=181)

<details>
  <summary>If you do use coolify, click this text </summary>- Choose the server: localhost
</details>

When setting up the VPS, make sure:

- your feed is accessible through https (a domain name is required :/)
-

{/* provide info to how to run with coolify the app? tsx blabla */}

{/* ======================================================================================== */}

{/* ===================== */}

This post is already long, also you might be interested to use something else than coolify.

<details>
  <summary>If you do use coolify, click this text </summary>- When setting it up, choose the server:
  localhost not remote
</details>

To go deeper and especially take care of the security, I highlighy recommend [the video from CJ](https://youtu.be/taJlPG82Ucw?si=6X-tUxQ8_5BlCINx&t=181)

However, I'm going to provide the minium and not so secure steps to run an app with coolify

{/* ===================== */}

I chose OVH as a hosting provider with [the Starter plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/vps)

After paying I get by email: the ip address, password and user to connect with to the server.

- Let's use ssh to access the VPS:

```bash
ssh myUser@127.0.0.1
```

It should ask for the password provided by email.

Now, to make our life easier when deploying we are going to use Coolify.

To go deeper and especially take care of the security, I highlighy recommend [the video from CJ](https://youtu.be/taJlPG82Ucw?si=6X-tUxQ8_5BlCINx&t=181)

However, I'm going to provide the minium and not so secure steps to run an app with coolify

- Install coolify by running on your VPS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```

<details>
  <summary>To fix "Please run this script as root or with sudo" click this text</summary>
- Try again as root, to become root:  
```bash
su - root
```

- If you don't have the root password, you should be able to set one with:

```bash
sudo passwd root
```

</details>

After installing coolify, the dashboard should be accessble at: http://your.vps.ip.address:8000

- Go to http://your.vps.ip.address:8000 and create your coolify account

- Choose localhost for the server

- Create your first project

serverless and websocket how does it work?

## publish

NOTES:

coolify:
sudo passwd root?
then use root user to run the coolify bash command
don't add your volumes in /app, it is not accessible
setup project domain (web dev feed > https://api.webdevfeed.online)
firefox prevent https access cause: self signed ssl certificate
=> means domains name in project setting is https

When publishing, error:
Invalid app.bsky.feed.generator record: Record/did must be a valid did
=> remove the http(s):// from the did

could not resolve identity: did:web:boc48gookcswcoo884o0owck.167.114.2.165.sslip.io
=> the did in /xrpc/app.bsky.feed.describeFeedGenerator or the id in /.well-known/did.json
=> code throwing the error: https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/53fcc2fbcbda9b325eeffb5705126831baf2a427/packages/bsky/src/api/app/bsky/feed/getFeedGenerator.ts#L34
=> your website need to be accessible on httpS:// (ssl needed)
=> project may have not been redeployed when adding this https domain which didn't trigger a certificate generation?
=> use https url in domain in project > domain
=> restart the proxy servers > proxy > restart (may need 2 hours to make it work) + redeploy your app

Message from server: invalid feed generator service details in did document: did:web:api.webdevfeed.online
=> in /.well-known/did.json, the service return does not have the id "#bsky_fg"
=> source code: https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/3303ff16a482a8dc6d31edc970398794184032d4/packages/bsky/src/api/app/bsky/feed/getFeedGenerator.ts#L47
=> it is "bsky_fg" not "#bsky_fg" WRONG you need the #
=> Bluesky may take a bit of time to access the updates of your feed (like the id update)

How to debug?
Use public endpoint from hoppscotch

You need a domain name
add the ip address of your server to your domain provider
add the domain name to coolify
