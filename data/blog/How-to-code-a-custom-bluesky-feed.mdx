## Introduction

I found the feed builders a bit limited so I wanted to build my own.
I managed to find a [Feed Generator template](https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator) but was completely lost in the code. This is why I decided to make my own from scratch!


## TL;DR

We are building this:

![custom feed architecture](/static/images/bluesky-feed-architecture.png)


## Setup the repository

- Create a directory and initialize npm: 

```bash
mkdir my-custom-feed &&
cd my-custom-feed &&
npm init -y
```

- Create a tsconfig.json file:

```bash
touch tsconfig.json
```

- Paste the following config in the file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["es2023"],
    "module": "node16",
    "target": "es2023",
    "moduleResolution": "node16",
    "removeComments": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "allowJs": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "checkJs": true
  },
  "include": [".eslintrc.cjs", "**/*.ts", "**/*.cjs", "**/*.js"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

- Create the entry point of your app in the src directory and log out Hello world

```bash
mkdir src && echo 'console.log("hello world");' > src/server.ts

```

- Install typescript, tsx to run the server.ts file and nodes types

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript tsx @types/node
```

- You should see "hello world" in the terminal when running:

```bash
tsx watch ./src/server.ts
```

## Connect to the jetstream

Now, we need data. Let's connect to bluesky's jetstreams to get the newly created posts, likes, and more.

- To connect to a jetstream, install @skyware/jetstream and ws:

```bash
npm install @skyware/jetstream ws &&
npm install --save-dev @types/ws
```

- create a jetstream.ts file with the following content in the src directory:

```ts
import { Jetstream } from "@skyware/jetstream";
import WebSocket from "ws";

export const jetstream = new Jetstream({
  wantedCollections: [
  "app.bsky.feed.post",
],
  ws: WebSocket,
});

jetstream.onCreate("app.bsky.feed.post", (event) => {
  console.log(event.commit.record)
});
```

- Now, be ready to stop your server this is going to spam logs, start the jetstream in your server.ts

```ts title={}
import { jetstream } from "./jetstream.js";

jetstream.start();
```

You should have crazy amount of logs poping in your terminal now.
Good job, you succesffully connected to the jetstream üëç

You can stop the server for now.
Now that we have data, we need to store in our database only the data we are interested in.

## Setup the database

We will use [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview) and SQLite (see [drizzle doc for sqlite](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started/sqlite-new)) but you can use whatever database you'd like.

- Install the dependencies 

```bash
npm i drizzle-orm @libsql/client dotenv
npm i -D drizzle-kit
```

- In your src directory, create a database directory and a local.db file to it:

```bash
mkdir src/database && touch src/database/schemas.ts
```

- create a .env file in your root directory and add your DATABASE_URL variable:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="file:src/database/local.db"
```

- load the env variablew with dotenv in your server.ts file by adding this import at the top of the file:

```ts
import 'dotenv/config';
```

- create a database.ts file in src/database directory and add the following content:

```ts
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/libsql/node";

export const db = drizzle({
  connection: {
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  },
});
```

- create a schema.ts file in your database directory with the following content:

```ts
import { int, sqliteTable, text } from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";

export const postsTable = sqliteTable("posts", {
  id: int().primaryKey({ autoIncrement: true }),
  uri: text().notNull().unique(),
  interestScore: int().notNull(),
  createdAt: int({ mode: "timestamp" }),
});
```

- Create a drizzle.config.ts file in the root of your project and add the following content:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";

export default defineConfig({
  out: "./drizzle",
  schema: "./src/database/schemas.ts",
  dialect: "sqlite",
  dbCredentials: {
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  },
});
```

- Now apply the post schema to the local.db file:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

Now we can add posts for our feed to the database. But first, we need an algorithm to decide if we should store or not the post.

## Algorithm

What we look for is posts talking about javascript and with embedded content (image, video, links, etc.)

- In your jetstream.ts file, add the following function:

```ts
import type { CommitCreate } from "@skyware/jetstream";
import { BLACKLIST, KEYWORDS_REGEX } from "./constants.js";
// ...rest of the imports

const BLOCK_LIST = ['NSFW word1', 'NSFW word2']
const ALLOWED_REGEX = /\bjavascript\b/i

type StandardAlgoArgs = {
  record: CommitCreate<"app.bsky.feed.post">["record"];
};
export function standardAlgo({ record }: StandardAlgoArgs) {
  let score = 0;
  let denied = false;

  switch (record.$type) {
    case "app.bsky.feed.post": {
      record.labels?.values.forEach((value) => {
        if (BLACKLIST.labels.includes(value.val)) {
          denied = true;
        }
      });
      if (denied) {
        return 0;
      }

      const isAboutWebdev = ALLOWED_REGEX.test(record.text);
      if (isAboutWebdev) {
        score = score + 1;

        if (record.embed) {
          score = score + 1;
        }
      }

      break;
    }

    default:
      break;
  }

  return score;
}

// ... rest of the code
```

- Now, use the standardAlgo function to decide if we store the received post to the database:

```ts
import { db } from "./database/database.js";
// ... rest of the imports

// ...

jetstream.onCreate("app.bsky.feed.post", (event) => {
  const record = event.commit.record;
  const interestScore = standardAlgo({ record });

  if (interestScore > 0) {
    const did = event.did;
    const recordKey = event.commit.rkey;

    await db.insert(postsTable).values({
        interestScore,
        uri: `at://${did}/app.bsky.feed.post/${recordKey}`,
    });
  }
});
```







NOTES:

coolify:
sudo passwd root?
then use root user to run the coolify bash command
don't add your volumes in /app, it is not accessible
setup project domain (web dev feed > https://api.webdevfeed.online)
firefox prevent https access cause: self signed ssl certificate
=> means domains name in project setting is https


When publishing, error:
Invalid app.bsky.feed.generator record: Record/did must be a valid did
=> remove the http(s):// from the did


could not resolve identity: did:web:boc48gookcswcoo884o0owck.167.114.2.165.sslip.io
=> the did in /xrpc/app.bsky.feed.describeFeedGenerator or the id in /.well-known/did.json
=> code throwing the error: https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/53fcc2fbcbda9b325eeffb5705126831baf2a427/packages/bsky/src/api/app/bsky/feed/getFeedGenerator.ts#L34
=> your website need to be accessible on httpS:// (ssl needed)
=> project may have not been redeployed when adding this https domain which didn't trigger a certificate generation?
=> use https url in domain in project > domain
=> restart the proxy servers > proxy > restart (may need 2 hours to make it work) + redeploy your app

Message from server: invalid feed generator service details in did document: did:web:api.webdevfeed.online
=> in /.well-known/did.json, the service return does not have the id "#bsky_fg" 
=> source code: https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/3303ff16a482a8dc6d31edc970398794184032d4/packages/bsky/src/api/app/bsky/feed/getFeedGenerator.ts#L47
=> it is "bsky_fg" not "#bsky_fg" WRONG you need the #
=> Bluesky may take a bit of time to access the updates of your feed (like the id update)

How to debug?
Use public endpoint from hoppscotch

You need a domain name
add the ip address of your server to your domain provider
add the domain name to coolify
